                  <p><span style={{"font-weight": "400"}}>Abex Tour was founded in 2008 by Alex Malcolm, who wanted to show people the side of a country that not everyone gets to see. &nbsp;While working in Brazil, he was lucky enough to travel the country with local friends who took him to places and shared things he would never have experienced on his own. He felt there was a space to create these unique travel experiences with a personal, human touch for others – and flew back to the UK to start his own company. Though we started out just selling trips to Brazil, Jacada now sells trips around the world; and despite our growth, Alex’s vision still remains. Personal is how we began, and that’s how we continue to be. </span></p>
                  <p><span style={{"font-weight": "400"}}>In 2020, The Jacada brand joined the family of Wilderness Safaris, a strong and reputable organisation, which for nearly 40 years has offered luxury travel experiences, composed around the commitment to conserve wilderness and wildlife.</span></p>
